# CIS2207
Sinclair Community College's third installment of C++ classes, CIS 2207 offers the study of Data Abstraction and Problem Solving.
The course moves through ADT's, Recursion, Algorithms and more.
I am only adding projects well after the due dates for the Fall '21 semester.
As always, I am always available for collaboration.
