* Design and implement an ADT for a one-person guessing game that chooses n random integers in the range of 1 to m and asks the user to guess them.  The same integer might be chosen more than once.  For example, the game might choose the following four integers that range from 1 to 10: 4, 6, 1, 6.
* The following interactions could occur between the user and the game, after the user has specified the integers m and n:
*   Enter the Number of Integers (n): 4
*   Enter the Number of Each Integers from 1 to (m): 10
*   Enter your guesses for the 4 integers in the range from 1 to 10 that have been selected: 1 2 3 4
*   2 of your guesses are correct.  Guess again.
*   Enter your guesses for the 4 integers in the range from 1 to 10 that have been selected: 2 4 6 8
*   2 of your guesses are correct.  Guess again.
*   Enter your guesses for the 4 integers in the range from 1 to 10 that have been selected: 1 4 6 6
*   You are correct! Play again? No
